Pure-FTPd is a free (BSD license) FTP Server with a strong focus on software
security. It can be compiled and run on a variety of Unix-like computer
operating systems including Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD,
Solaris, Tru64, Darwin, Irix and HP-UX. It has also been ported to Android.[1]

## History

Pure-FTPd is based on Troll-FTPd, written by Arnt Gulbrandsen while he was working at Trolltech from 1995-1999. When Gulbrandsen stopped maintaining Troll-FTPd, Frank Denis created Pure-FTPd in 2001, and it is currently developed by a team led by Denis.[2]
